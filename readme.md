# Testing

To run, make sure you use "npm install", then run "node index.js". You can then point a browser to localhost:3000 to see the UI. 

# Notes

Normally I would use React to set this up, however, a stipulation of the project is not to use React, which is why I use raw javascript alongsid public html.
